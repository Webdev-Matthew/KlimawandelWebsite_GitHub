      <h1>Reasons for the climate change</h1>
      <p>
        Global warming (which is a Consequence for the climate change) is due to
        the greenhouse effect. At first, we would like to explain which types of
        greenhouse effects everyone should know.
      </p>
      <h2>The natural greenhouse effect</h2>
      <p>
        This effects isn't made by humans. Without this effect, there would be
        no life on our planet earth. The natural greenhouse effect's job is to
        stop reflected sunbeams back into space after they've shined on the
        earth. The greenhouse layer of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrogen
        oxides is managing this phenomenon. Without this effect, the earth would
        be frozen at <strong>-18&deg;C</strong>. So, now you probably ask
        yourself, why some countries would like to minimize this gas, which are
        pushed out by Cars. Thats the human-caused greenhouse effect.
      </p>
      <h2>The human-caused greenhouse effect</h2>
      <p></p>
      <!--One reason for the climate change are greenhouse gas (consists carbon dioxide, methane and nitrogen oxides) from combustor engines. The greenhouse effect is 
        created by
        those greenhouse gas. It's determination is, that sunbeams can't be reflected back into space after they've shined on the earth becuase of the greenhouse gas (Co2).-->
