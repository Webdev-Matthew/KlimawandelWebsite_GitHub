      <h1>Reasons for the climate change</h1>
      <p>
        Global warming (which is a Consequence for the climate change) is due to
        the greenhouse effect. At first, we would like to explain which types of
        greenhouse effects everyone should know.
      </p>
      <h2>The natural greenhouse effect</h2>
      <p>
        This effects isn't made by humans. Without this effect, there would be
        no life on our planet earth. The natural greenhouse effect's job is to
        stop reflected sunbeams back into space after they've shined on the
        earth. The greenhouse layer of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrogen
        oxides is managing this phenomenon. Without this effect, the earth would
        be frozen at <strong>-18&deg;C</strong>.
      </p>
      <h2>The human-caused greenhouse effect</h2>
      <p>The human-caused greenhouse effect is, as the name said, a greenhouse effect, which is not natural
        and made by humans. How? Simple answer: Burning fossil fuels, argriculture and land clearing are
      increasing the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. The more greenhouse gases 
      are in the atmosphere, the rarer sunbeams can be reflected back into space after shining on our earth.
      Thats why many humans - especially teenager -, for example the <a href="https://fridaysforfuture.de/">
      Friday's for future</a> organisation want to send the government a message and demonstrate against
      the effect. In may 2019,the share in the atmosphere of CO2 is at 415 parts per million. In 2015
    the share was at 400 ppm.</p>
      <!--Human activities such as burning fossil fuels, agriculture and land clearing are increasing the amount
         of
         greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere.
        One reason for the climate change are greenhouse gas (consists carbon dioxide, methane and nitrogen
         oxides) from combustor engines. The greenhouse effect is 
        created by
        those greenhouse gas. It's determination is, that sunbeams can't be reflected back into space after
         they've shined on the earth becuase of the greenhouse gas (Co2).-->
